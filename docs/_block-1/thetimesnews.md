description: January 3rd 2009 The Times News printed the headline "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". The same message satoshi issued in the genesis block of bitcoin. This is an evolving piece. Artists in the community make thier own creative iterations of the newspaper cover. The artists iteration is added to the original block and the artists piece is issued individually as a subassest with a supply of 2009 and sent to all holders of the grail, at the time of thier issuance. The remaining supply is then sent to the owner along with the ownership rights of the assest. Contribute your own version - Here
