Using sub-assest:

You can use subassets in any way you like, and we love to see new and creative ways artists and creator are incorperating them in to their works.

If you want some inpiration here are a few ideas and ways others are using them:

- Multi panel pieces, 1 piece that is broken in to multiple blocks - <a href = "card-1/btcblocks">Example</a>

- Grail Card - The main asset holders will recieve either all subs, or all future subs from time of purchase  - <a href = "card-1/thetimesnews">Example</a>

- Evolving Art. The main assest changes over time with the addition of new frames. (stills issued as subassest) - <a href = "card-1/thetimesnews">Example</a>

- Issuing a Physical Piece as a 1 of 1 with the subassest being used as the official digital "prints" - <a href = "link.com">Example</a>
